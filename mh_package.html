<p>Start your city tour with the excursion to the splendid Amber Fort, an architectural masterpiece of great historical significance. Begun in the 16th century and built of red sandstone and marble, the seemingly rough exterior gives no hint of the warm and opulent ambiance of the interior, as you’ll discover this morning. Here you also get an opportunity to climb up to the fort on decorated elephant back. </p>
<p>In the afternoon visit the splendid City Palace & Museum which opens a door into the opulent world of the Rajput princes and the treasures with which they surrounded themselves. The City Palace complex is home to several palatial buildings constructed by influential rulers that reflect the blending of Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles. Maharaja Jai Singh II built Jantar Mantar, the world’s biggest stone observatory, between 1727 and 1733 AD. You’ll be amazed by the “tools” he used to study the heavens – and that still provide accurate information today – during a tour. Further visit the Palace of Winds also known as Hawa Mahal, a five storeyed wonder with a spectacular pyramidal facade and overhanging windows with latticed screens, domes and spires.</p>

<li>
<div class="days"><span>Day 07:</span><p>	Aurangabad – Ajanta – Aurangabad (By Surface: 100 kms / 02 hrs)</p></div>
<div class="day-cnt"><p>After breakfast leave for an excursion to view the amazing and striking Ajanta caves which are the main tourist attractions of the city. </p>

<p>Located near the Sahaydri Hills, Ajanta Caves is a little far from the Aurangabad. The 100 km journey from Aurangabad to the Ajanta caves is completed in a little span of time. Located at a distance of 3 and a half kilometre from the village Ajanta, these provide a blissful view of the caves which are named after the village Ajanta only. An amazing fact is that these 29 caves out of the 30 are built on a horse-shoe shaped ravine. As dedicated to the Buddha, these caves are made just like other Buddhist monastery having viharas and chaityas. The viharas which are the monastic halls of residence have a special appearance and these huge halls are always accompanied with silence and harmony. The silence and harmony brings it closer to the spiritual world. Another amazing fact is that these Ajanta caves were discarded during 480 AD due to some serious issues. But luckily, the Europeans rediscovered the ancient masterpieces clubbed together in the Ajanta Caves. The support or rather the columns that support the ceiling of the caves has excellent art work depicting the work of those times. You must not have seen paintings on the ceilings but when you are visiting the Ajanta caves, you'd be delighted to see and cherish it. The pictorial art i.e. the paintings or the artwork in the sculptures are worth admiring. By evening return back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Overnight at hotel in Aurangabad.</p>

</li>
<li>
<div class="days"><span>Day 08:</span><p> Aurangabad – Mumbai (By Flight)</p></div>
<div class="day-cnt"><p>After breakfast we visit the Ellora Caves and Daulatabad Fort.</p>
<p><strong>Ellora Caves:</strong> The Rashtrakuta rulers produced the architectural giant which is what now known as the Ajanta Caves. Only at a distance of 30 km from the Aurangabad city, these caves are mainly famous for the Buddhist monasteries and the temples that are superior in architectural beauty. 34 Cave temples and 12 Buddhist caves make the major part of the Ellora Caves. Dedicated to the Lord Shiva, these temples always have a crowd throughout the year who are the lovers of the Lord Shiva. In addition to the religious importance, the historical reasons and beauty worth admiring pulls the tourists from all over the world especially those who love admiring historical buildings. An entrance, courtyard, sanctorum, vestibule and a tower are the excellent part of each of the caves. Interestingly, all of them have been carved out of a single gigantic rock. Now, you can figure out the labour and work done by the people of those times. Dravidian Art is mainly determined by the sculpture and paintings of the caves. Dravidians were prominent in the South of India and had some of the hold in the Western Ghats of the India which influenced the sculptures and paintings to have a touch closer to the Dravidian art. </p>

<p>Scholars, archaeologists and many other historians took interest behind the mysteries of these caves and thus have given it a special place in the list of the UNESCO's world heritage sites. </p>

<p><strong>Daulatabad Fort :</strong> Only a single fort in the city where the caves are prominent, Daulatabad Fort is the rarest kind of monuments which could be found while wandering on the streets of the Aurangabad Fort. Lying a little outside the Aurangabad on a hill which is only 13 Kms away from it. The hill and the surrounding areas were a part of a city which was earlier known as the Daulatabad, a name given by the famous Muhammad Tughlaq. The passages in the fort are tricky and thus create fun while visiting it. The walls of the Fort are made of sandstone materials and the large courtyard just after the entrance constitute as some of the salient parts of the building. The winds pass frequently through the fort making a cool atmosphere inside it. </p>
<p>Evening in time transfer to airport to connect flight to Mumbai. </p>
<p>Overnight at the hotel in Mumbai.</p>

<div class="days"><span>Day 09:</span><p> Mumbai</p></div>

<p>Start your day with the excursion to Elephant Island by cruise from Gateway of India which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Marvel at the rock-cut cave temples with sculptured interiors dating back to the 6th century. A highlight is the Mahesamurti, a triple-headed Shiva statue. By afternoon return back to the city and have your lunch. </p>

<p>Afternoon enjoy the your city tour visiting the Prince of Wales Museum to enjoy its excellent collection of ancient Indus Valley artifacts dating back to 2000 BC, in addition to priceless Tibetan and Nepali Art followed by Mani Bhawan, the former residence of Mahatma Gandhi that includes a reference library with over 2,000 books, a photo exhibition of Gandhi's life and an old charkha or spinning wheel that Gandhi used.
